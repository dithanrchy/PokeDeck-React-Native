# Pokedec Application

Pokedec is an app that brings the world of Pokémon to your fingertips, displaying Pokémon in a style similar to a deck of cards. Each Pokémon is represented as a card, and users can sort, filter, and explore detailed information about them. The app fetches data from the Pokémon GraphQL API and provides an engaging way to interact with the Pokémon universe.

## Features

- **Sorting**: Sort the deck of Pokémon by name in ascending or descending order.
- **Filter**: Filter Pokémon cards based on types.
- **Pokémon Details**: Tap on a Pokémon card to view detailed information, including stats and abilities.

## Technologies Used
